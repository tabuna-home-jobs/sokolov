    'main' => 'The Falcon Scientific Editing team is eager to show
                our customers the exceptional quality of our work.
                We do not want to use empty words to try to
                convince you. We want to show you. Paraphrasing a
                saying, we believe that “Our samples are worth a
                thousand words”. We invite you to evaluate our work
                and make your own judgement of its quality.',

    'editing' => 'There is no greater reward for us than to
                know that the papers that we edit are not overlooked
                by journal editors because of language issues. Please
                see the before and after views of our samples to
                better understand the impact of our editing services.
                The samples vividly demonstrate just how significant
                the changes can be. We put a lot of care into making
                sure that every sentence sounds just right and
                conveys the originally intended meaning. We do not
                plagiarize. We do not change meaning. We make the
                sentences sound as if a native English speaker wrote
                them. We include helpful comments and suggestions
                regarding the language, inconsistencies, and
                technical terms. We edit sentence-by- sentence and
                remove any linguistic problems that would raise red
                flags for the journal editors and the reviewers.',

    'translation' => 'With translation, the challenge is even
                    more significant. However, our experienced
                    translators perform a stellar job. To make the
                    translation even better, our Ph.D. editors always edit
                    the papers after translation. Thus, the final product is
                    a beautifully translated work that retains its original
                    meaning. No journal editor or reviewer would ever
                    make a comment about the language problems. To
                    show our ability to translate text from various fields,
                    we include before and after samples of the papers
                    from the sciences, the humanities and business.',

    'formatting' => 'Formatting references and manuscripts
                    is a tedious task. However, if the paper is ever to be
                    published, the formatting issues cannot be
                    overlooked. Please evaluate our formatting samples.
                    We efficiently create a cohesive structure out of
                    disordered text to meet journal requirements.',

    'illustration' => 'Illustration samples are always a
                    pleasure to look at. It is exhilarating to see a bland
                    illustration or a concept drawing that is transformed
                    into a publication-worthy figure. Our professional
                    illustrators work side by side with our Ph.D. editors to
                    produce beautiful and scientifically accurate figures.
                    You can send us your drawing on a napkin if you like.
                    If something is unclear in the original concept art, we
                    will contact you for clarifications. We will go back and
                    forth with you as many times as necessary until we
                    produce a high-quality and publication-worthy image
                    that meets your standards.',
